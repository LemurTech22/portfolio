The dataset was automatically structured into folders by class and split, eliminating the need for manual partitioning. Images were preprocessed using TensorFlow’s image_dataset_from_directory function to ensure consistent dimensions (224×334 pixels) and normalized via a Rescaling(1./255) layer. The CNN architecture consisted of three convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (16, 32, 64), each followed by MaxPooling layers to progressively reduce spatial dimensions and retain key features. The extracted features were flattened and passed through two dense layers (128 neurons, then 2 output classes). The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer, Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss, and accuracy as the evaluation metric. It was trained over 5 epochs, achieving the following key results: Training Accuracy: 98.1% Validation Accuracy: 93.7% Validation Loss: 0.0631 Performance visualization indicated stable convergence with minimal overfitting.

Correlation analysis and heatmaps identified relationships among numeric features. Strong correlations (|r| > 0.5) were highlighted using corrplot.

The primary objective was to build predictive models that estimate a student’s term GPA based on sleep patterns, prior academic performance, and demographic characteristics. The analysis was carried out in R, with multiple modeling approaches—linear regression, polynomial regression, stepwise regression, generalized linear models (GLMs), and neural networks—used to compare predictive performance and interpret the influence of key variables.',
        challenge: 'Expores sleep behaviors and academic performance.',
        technical: 'The workflow began with loading and preparing the dataset. After reading in the CSV file, summary statistics were generated for term_gpa to understand the overall performance distribution before modeling. The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets across ten iterations to ensure robustness and reduce sampling bias. Categorical variables, such as demo_race, were converted into factors to allow the models to interpret them correctly. Irrelevant identifiers like cohort and subject_id were removed to prevent noise in the analysis. Missing values were handled using na.omit() to ensure complete data for model fitting. An initial exploratory analysis examined correlations among numeric variables such as total sleep time, cumulative GPA, daytime sleep, and other behavioral metrics. The correlation matrix revealed that cum_gpa had a strong positive relationship with term_gpa, indicating that past academic performance was a major predictor of current-term success. Moderate relationships were also observed between TotalSleepTime, daytime_sleep, and term_gpa, suggesting that better sleep consistency may be associated with improved grades. Scatterplot matrices were used to visualize these relationships and identify any potential nonlinear patterns worth modeling. The first predictive model built was a multiple linear regression, which used all available predictors to estimate term_gpa. This baseline model achieved a reasonable fit, but the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both training and testing sets indicated room for improvement, especially on unseen data. Next, a polynomial regression model was developed to capture possible nonlinear effects of continuous variables like daytime sleep and cumulative GPA. The polynomial model demonstrated a reduction in test MSE compared to the baseline, confirming that nonlinear relationships between sleep variables and academic performance improved predictive accuracy. To further refine the model, stepwise regression was applied to automatically select the most significant predictors using a combination of forward and backward selection based on AIC (Akaike Information Criterion). This approach reduced model complexity while retaining key variables that had the strongest explanatory power. The resulting stepwise model achieved lower MSE values on both training and testing sets, highlighting that eliminating weaker predictors enhanced generalization. A reduced GLM model was also constructed using only TotalSleepTime and cum_gpa, since these variables consistently showed strong significance across prior models. Repeated testing across ten iterations confirmed the stability of this reduced model, with an average test MSE demonstrating consistent predictive performance.',
        results: 'To validate model robustness, k-fold cross-validation was performed using the boot package. Several models—including the polynomial, full GLM, simpler GLM, and reduced models—were cross-validated to compare generalization error. The cross-validation results supported the earlier findings: the reduced and polynomial GLM models offered the best balance between accuracy and simplicity. The delta values from the cross-validation confirmed that overfitting was minimal and that the reduced models generalized well to unseen data. The final stage of the project extended the analysis using a neural network model built with the neuralnet library. Before training, the dataset was normalized to ensure all continuous variables were on comparable scales. The neural network architecture consisted of one hidden layer with five neurons and used TotalSleepTime, daytime_sleep, cum_gpa, and demo_gender as input features to predict term_gpa. The model was trained and evaluated ten times using different random splits of the data, with mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) recorded for each iteration. On average, the neural network achieved a low mean test MAE and MSE, indicating that it effectively captured complex, nonlinear relationships between sleep patterns and academic outcomes.',

Each item can be added, modified, or removed from the database, ensuring that library administrators maintain accurate and up-to-date records of all available materials.

        technical: 'The application defines three main user roles—Admin, Student, and Faculty—each with distinct permissions and responsibilities. The Admin role oversees the entire system, with full access to create, view, update, and delete user and item records. Admins are also responsible for managing fines, approving item transactions, and generating financial reports. Students and Faculty members serve as standard users who can borrow and return items while being accountable for any late or damaged materials. They also have the ability to pay outstanding fines through the system. This role-based design ensures proper access control and operational integrity within the database environment. A key feature of the project is its use of semantic constraints and database triggers to automate fine management and maintain data consistency. The first trigger activates after a late or damaged item is processed, automatically updating the user’s outstanding balance by adding any associated fees to their total. This guarantees real-time accuracy in tracking penalties and user balances. The second trigger executes after a payment is made, deducting the paid amount from the user’s outstanding fees and simultaneously recording the transaction in the earnings table. This dual mechanism maintains both the user’s balance and the library’s revenue log, ensuring a transparent and traceable financial workflow. Together, these triggers enforce semantic integrity by keeping the displayed fee data synchronized with the underlying transactionsThe database supports a variety of queries and reports that allow users and administrators to interact with and analyze system data efficiently. Standard queries are used to retrieve complete lists of users, items, or transactions, while parameterized queries enable precise lookups—such as finding a specific user by username, checking borrowed items for a given user, or displaying current fines. The system also allows insertion, deletion, and updating of records across all major tables, supporting operations like adding new users, registering newly available items, or updating user profiles.In addition to transactional queries, the system provides several reporting features that summarize library operations and financial performance. Reports can be generated to show total revenue by user, total revenue by item, or aggregate revenue across all users and items. These reports are powered by the earnings table, which captures all payment transactions initiated by users. This capability allows administrators to monitor trends in fines, evaluate item popularity based on associated fees, and generate revenue insights for institutional review.',

By combining user role permissions, real-time fee synchronization through triggers, and a comprehensive set of data queries and reports, the system provides a reliable platform for managing all aspects of library operations.
