                Hi, I am Jose Conde — a software developer and data scientist who loves creating technology that is both smart and meaningful.
                My work lives at the intersection of code, data, and design. I enjoy building full-stack applications that do not just look great, 
                but also think — powered by data-driven insights and machine learning models that solve real-world problems. A Jack of All Trades!
